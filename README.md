# RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation

Created a sample notebook using two books as documents -

1. Abhinav Bhindra's Biography in the name of '**A Shot at History**' - requesting everyone to read it - very motivating and inspiring.
2. A Statistics based book - 'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists' published by O'Reilly.


Key Summary of the notebook;

1. Used FAISS as the similarity search tool and vector DB because of its ease of integration using Langchain.
2. Used sentence embeddings from Hugging Face to convert text to embeddings for storage.
3. Utilised Cohere's API (as a starting point) to define the most suitable model for the task.
